# Search Github React PointFree Sample
This is a sample application that demonstrates how to build a React application using functional PointFree paradigm.  It uses [RamdaJS](http://ramdajs.com/) library, [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com) framework, [data.future](https://www.npmjs.com/package/data.future).

It uses Github API and is modeled after https://github.com/eggheadio/react-native-gh-notetaker.

Most importantly, the knowledge I use to develop this application is built from lessons that I learned from [DrBoolean](https://github.com/DrBoolean)
